        The Burj Khalifa is an iconic skyscraper located in Dubai, United Arab Emirates. Standing at 
        a staggering height of 828 meters (2,717 feet), it is currently the tallest building in the world. 
        Designed by the renowned architect Adrian Smith, the Burj Khalifa was completed in 2010 after six 
        years of construction. It features a unique stepped design inspired by Islamic architecture and incorporates 
        numerous cutting-edge technologies for sustainability and efficiency. The building houses luxury apartments, 
        corporate offices, hotels, restaurants, observation decks, and entertainment venues, making it a symbol of Dubai's modernity and ambition.
