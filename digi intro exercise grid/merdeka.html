    Merdeka 118 is a towering skyscraper currently being constructed in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. 
    Scheduled for completion in the near future, it is set to stand as one of the tallest buildings 
    globally, reaching a height of approximately 644 meters (2,113 feet). Named after Malaysia's 
    independence, "Merdeka," the skyscraper holds symbolic significance, reflecting the nation's 
    progress and modernity. Designed by the acclaimed architectural firm Fender Katsalidis 
    Architects, Merdeka 118 will feature a diverse mix of functions, including commercial spaces, 
    residential units, a hotel, and observation decks. This ambitious project underscores Malaysia's 
    commitment to urban development and aims to become a prominent landmark in the Kuala 
    Lumpur skyline upon its completion.
